AuthorsNotebook is a suite of applications focused on helping authors create
novels.

The project is run on a few key ideals:

* *Professional* The target audience is professional authors, or those wishing
  to be professional.
* *Users own their content* The users should be able to access their data easily
  without the application. The formats must be easily interpreted - by non-tech
  professionals
* *Orthogonality* Libraries should do one thing and do it well. Applications
  will wrap these functional pieces.
